## About:
This project is an Implementation of an algorithm designed to make a set of agents collect as many pokemons as possible, all upon a directed weighted graph. 
The game is executed completety via a given server, and "plays" according to the rules or our algorithm.
the server has 15 different test cases, which diverse in the number of pokemons on the playing field, the number of participating agents, the graph parameters, and the time untill termination.
Each pokemon, also has a value to it, which is translated into the speed of the agents which manages to take it.

### Running the program from your command line:  
  
download all files from this repository to the same file on your pc. Then, type the following command on your terminal:
java -jar Ex4_Server_v0.0.jar \<case number\>

After running said command, run the student_code.py program, and enjoy!
